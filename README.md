<p>
  A registration form built using HTML and CSS collects user details such as name, email, password, and other optional fields. The form includes labeled input fields, placeholders, and validation attributes to ensure proper input. CSS is used to style the form for a visually appealing layout, responsive design, and clear error messages. It often features a submit button and links for additional actions like login or password recovery. This frontend-only form ensures usability and aesthetics, laying the foundation for further backend integration or functionality enhancements.
